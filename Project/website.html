                <strong>S</strong>hall I compare thee to a summer's day?
                <br><strong>T</strong>hou art more lovely and more temperate:
                <br><strong>R</strong>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                <br><strong>A</strong>nd summer's lease hath all too short a date: 
                <br><strong>S</strong>ometime's too hot the eye of heaven shines,
                <br><strong>A</strong>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
                <br><strong>A</strong>nd every fair from fair sometimes declines,
                <br><strong>B</strong>y chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
                <br><strong>B</strong>ut thy external summmer shall not fade,
                <br><strong>N</strong>or lose possesion of that fair thou ow'st,
                <br><strong>N</strong>or shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
